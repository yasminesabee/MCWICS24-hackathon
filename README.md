# Pyhton Formation

## What it does

The program we created allows businesses and corporations to test their employees' python skills. It is a Python Formation program that consists of three difficulty levels. An employee doing this formation is going to encounter several Python exercises starting from Level 1. The employee is going to have the choice to skip certain levels if he feels comfortable.

## How we built it

Considering the whole team are beginners, we only were able to use Python. We created four different files to include our 3 levels and our main program that were able to be run in the shell. We then created a new file to implant the tkinter package and create a user friendly interface.

## Challenges we ran into

As we mentioned the whole team are beginners, so we had to do a lot of research concerning the tkinter package since it was our first time using it and creating any sort of interface.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are really proud of ourselves to be able to complete the interface and the project as a whole, considering it's our first hackathon and our first computer science "personal' project!

## What we learned

We learned how a project can be very fun and stressful at the same time. By surrounding ourselves with people we work well with and enjoy their company, a project will always be fun to work on. Also breaks are important!

## What's next for Python Formation

If we had more time and more skills, we would love to add more questions in each level. We would also like to create an actual website with beautiful designs and functions that would facilitate the learning process of the employee. In an ideal world, we would be able to create a similar program for many programming languages.
